# 🧠 AI-Based Disease Prediction System

This project is a **dual-input AI disease prediction tool** that uses both  
**machine learning (symptom-based)** and **deep learning (MRI scan-based CNN)**  
to predict possible diseases. Users can either **enter symptoms** or **upload a scan image**,  
making the system helpful for **early diagnosis** and improved decision-making accuracy.

## ▶️ How It Works

### **1️⃣ Symptom-Based Prediction**
- User selects/input symptoms  
- ML model analyzes patterns  
- Predicts the most likely disease  

### **2️⃣ Scan-Based Prediction**
- User uploads MRI/CT scan  
- Image is preprocessed using OpenCV  
- CNN model predicts disease category
